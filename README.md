# Portfolio Optimization

This repository contains a portfolio optimization project completed during my Master's in Quantitative Finance at USI Lugano. It applies both analytical and simulation-based techniques to explore optimal asset allocation using DJIA data.

## Overview

The notebook is structured around four core components:

- **Summary Statistics & Volatility Modeling**  
  Daily log returns of DJIA constituents are analyzed, with annualized statistics and a GARCH(1,1) model applied to the DJIA index for volatility estimation.

- **Efficient Frontier Construction**  
  Analytical frontiers are computed both with and without short-selling, highlighting the role of constraints in shaping optimal portfolios.

- **Monte Carlo Experiment 1**  
  Random portfolios are generated using truncated normal and Dirichlet distributions to approximate the efficient frontier and explore the limits of simulation vs. analytical methods.

- **Monte Carlo Experiment 2**  
  Multiple random subsets of stocks are used to show how diversification influences returnâ€“risk characteristics and overall portfolio efficiency.

## Files

**`portfolio_optimization.ipynb`**  
The main notebook containing the entire workflow, from data download and preprocessing to analytical modeling and simulation results.

**`plots/`**  
Folder containing all generated figures used in the analysis and summary.

## Results Example

**Annualized Correlation Matrix of DJIA Stocks**  
Visualizes how strongly assets move together based on log returns.

**Monte Carlo Experiment 2: Long-Only Portfolios from Random Subsets**  
Highlights variability across 6 different random subsets under long-only constraints.

**Monte Carlo Experiment 2: Portfolios with Short Selling from Random Subsets**  
Same 6 subsets as above but allowing short-selling to illustrate impact on efficiency.

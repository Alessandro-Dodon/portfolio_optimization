# Portfolio Optimization

This repository contains a portfolio optimization project completed during my Master's in Quantitative Finance at USI Lugano. It applies both analytical and simulation-based techniques to explore optimal asset allocation using DJIA data.

## Overview

The notebook is structured around four core components:

- **Summary Statistics & Volatility Modeling**:  
  Daily log returns of DJIA constituents are analyzed, with annualized statistics and a GARCH(1,1) model applied to the DJIA index for volatility estimation.

- **Efficient Frontier Construction**:  
  Analytical frontiers are computed both with and without short-selling, highlighting the role of constraints in shaping optimal portfolios.

- **Monte Carlo Experiment 1**:  
  Random portfolios are generated using truncated normal and Dirichlet distributions to approximate the efficient frontier and explore the limits of simulation vs. analytical methods.

- **Monte Carlo Experiment 2**:  
  Multiple random subsets of stocks are used to show how diversification influences returnâ€“risk characteristics and overall portfolio efficiency.

## Files

## User Guide

1. **Setup**:  
   - Clone the repository (Recommended):  
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Alessandro-Dodon/portfolio_optimization.git
     cd portfolio_optimization
     ```
   - Or download as ZIP and extract locally.

2. **Execution**:  
   - Open `portfolio_optimization.ipynb` in Jupyter Lab, VS Code, or Anaconda.  
   - Run all cells to reproduce the analysis.  
   - An internet connection is required to download data from Yahoo Finance.

3. **Dependencies**:  
   - All required libraries are listed in the notebook.  
   - Use the `pip install` lines provided if any packages are missing.

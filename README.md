# Portfolio Optimization

This repository contains a portfolio optimization project completed during my Master's in Quantitative Finance at USI Lugano. The project centers around **numerical methods** for solving real-world portfolio selection problems using historical DJIA data.

Both **constrained optimization** (via SLSQP) and **Monte Carlo simulation** techniques are used to construct and analyze optimal portfolios, with a focus on understanding the effects of constraints, short selling, and diversification.

## Overview

The notebook is structured around four core components:

- **Summary Statistics & Volatility Modeling**  
  Daily log returns of DJIA constituents are analyzed. Annualized return and risk metrics are calculated, and a GARCH(1,1) model is applied to the DJIA index to capture conditional volatility.

- **Efficient Frontier via Constrained Optimization**  
  The efficient frontier is computed numerically using SLSQP, both with and without short-selling. A second version includes **custom constraints** (e.g., minimum/maximum weight per asset, limited short exposure) to reflect practical investment policies.

- **Monte Carlo Experiment 1**  
  A large number of portfolios are randomly generated using Dirichlet and truncated normal distributions. This experiment approximates the efficient frontier and compares it to constrained optimization results.

- **Monte Carlo Experiment 2**  
  Multiple random subsets of 5 stocks each are analyzed to show how diversification (or lack thereof) impacts riskâ€“return characteristics under both long-only and short-selling conditions.

## Results Example

Below are selected visual outputs showcasing key findings from the analysis:

- **Annualized Correlation Matrix of DJIA Stocks**  
  Visualizes how strongly stocks co-move based on log returns.

- **Efficient Frontier with and without Short-Selling**  
  Computed using SLSQP without custom bounds.

- **Efficient Frontier with Custom Constraints**  
  Reflects real-world bounds on asset weights. Indicates that practical constraints do not greatly reduce efficiency.

- **Monte Carlo Experiment 1: Full Universe Simulation**  
  Demonstrates how simulated portfolios approximate the efficient frontier using random weight generation.

- **Monte Carlo Experiment 2: Long-Only Portfolios from Random Subsets**  
  Illustrates performance variability and volatility across 6 random 5-stock portfolios under long-only constraints.

- **Monte Carlo Experiment 2: Portfolios with Short Selling from Random Subsets**  
  Same 6 subsets as above, but allowing short positions, showing increased frontier flexibility.
